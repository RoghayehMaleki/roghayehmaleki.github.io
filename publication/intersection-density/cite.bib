	abstract = {Given a finite transitive group G≤Sym(Ω), a subset F of G is intersecting if any two elements of F agree on some elements of Ω. The intersection density of G, denoted by ρ(G), is the maximum of the rational number |F|(|G||Ω|)−1 when F runs through all intersecting sets in G. In this paper, we prove that if G is the group Sym(n) or Alt(n) acting on the k-subsets of {1,2,3…,n}, for k∈{3,4,5}, then ρ(G)=1. Our proof relies on the representation theory of the symmetric group and the ratio bound.}
